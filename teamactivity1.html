			<p align="justify">Students were divided into groups. I was a member of super group Five. In group five we came up with a group contract which was signed by all group members. Each group was then tasked to develop a website using AWSEducate resources and share the Website address and IP address with the opposite team. While working with my team member in group 5, although another team member was tasked to develop the website, for learning purposes, on the sidelines, i personally configured a ehealth website named http://ehealth-env.eba-d6shft2m.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com/ with Private IP address: 172.31.33.240 and Allocated IPv4 address: 54.243.142.38. This website was later given to another group that had configuration problem to carryout the pentest. The artifacts of the website that i configured are shown in Figure 1:EC2 configurations,Figure 2:Elastic IP Addresses and Figure 3 Elastic Beanstalk are shown below:<small></small></p>

			  <font size="3" face="Arial" color="white"
			<p align="justify">Having personnaly configured the website, conducted a reconnaissance scans aganist the target website and further perfomed the penetration scan, my knowledge and skills on how a successful pentest is conducted has been tremendously increased and enhanced unlike when i started the Module. Knowledge and skill gained will go a long way to enhance my approach to future modules because i will approach them from an informed postion. Additionally, my confidence in the subject matter has increased. </p>
