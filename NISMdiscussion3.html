			<p align="justify">I looked at a case study in which Virgin Media Ireland Limited repeatedly made unsolicited marketing telephone calls to a customer who had not consented and demanded that her data be listed on “Do Not Call list” because she did not wish to be contacted concerning such matters whatsoever. Investigations conducted by the Data Protection Commission on the matter revealed that the company accepted responsibility explaining that it was due to human error that complainant’s request was not granted. The company alleged that it had earlier initiated efforts to ensure that to see all opt-out applications were granted. The company said that the complainant’s details have since been deleted from the marketing database and issued apologies (Data Protection Commission, 2021).  </p>
            <p align="justify">This case study looks at part of General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that deals with Consent. Intersoft consulting (2021) explains that it is only the law that can permit working on personal data with the subjects’ consent. Article 7 recital 32 of the GDPR explains that it is mandatory for consent to be precise, liberally granted, properly communicated and explicit. In other words consent is voluntary and is a subjects’ choice to grant the same.  For that matter, subjects should not be forced to give consent under duress whatsoever because such consent is deemed as void.</p>
			<p align="justify">The Data Protection Commissioner found Virgin Media Ireland Limited guilty of the offense. In another Court the company pleaded guilty to two charges of making unsolicited marketing calls to clients without consent while trading under a different company name earlier.</p>
			<p align="justify">As an Information Security Manager, I will advise my organization to abide by GDPR and follow the GDPR when dealing with customers data to avoid such complications.</p>

									<p align="justify">In this case, human error is the main issue of the case. The employees shared client contacts with third parties without consent from clients. According to the Privacy Compliance Hub (2020), benefits for conducting GPDR training to employees are:  </p>
									<ol>
									<li> Trust from the clientele which translates to more sales</li>
									<li>Client centered products hence increased client preference	</li>
									<li> Employee paradigm shift in regards to protection of client personal information</li>
									<li> Reduced litigation costs and legal battles for the company</li>

									   According to an important post made by Charlotte Wilson and  Freya Basey, In the Virgin Media Ireland Limited case study, the aspect of GDPR that is addressed is the “Right to Erasure”. Within the case study, an individual wanted to ensure they were not called for promotion purposes, and although multiple requests had been made changes were not conducted. Part of the “Right to Erasure” includes “Individuals can make a request for erasure verbally or in writing” and “a right for individuals to have personal data erased”, both of which the individual did and should have had in the case study (ICO, 2018). To rectify the situation, Virgin Media Ireland Limited reviewed all requests made within a certain time period and ensured all had been completed correctly, and any manual errors had been rectified.

									Laura Rivella also brought up a very important point indication that The case summary states that Virgin Media Ireland Limited cited human error as the cause for the complainant’s account not being updated correctly. (Data Protection Commission, 2017) You rightfully highlighted the fact that automation could ensure that manual error is limited.
									Automation appears to be applied in some areas in order to maximise profit by removing humans in call centers and substituting them with chatbots. So while the capability to apply automation is within reach of companies like VMIL, it is not being applied in a way that ensures data security or customer support. This should be kept in mind and revisited at a later date to check if legislation is being drafted around this issue.
									To cite human error when presented with legal action, especially in the case of multiple complaints and previous offenses under another name (Data Protection Commission, 2017) is preposterous. The latter being particularly concerning since it means that VMIL, previously trading as UPC Communications Ireland Limited has been exhibiting a good degree recidivism since 2010 at the very least. It is also worth noting that no mechanism to prevent marketing offenses from reoccurring appears to have been put in place between the first recorded offense in 2010 and 2017.
