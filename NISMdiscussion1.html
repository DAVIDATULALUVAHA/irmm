			<p align="justify">The authors used the Qualitative methods because no knowledge had previously been published in the domain of Security Risk Management(SRM) in relation to user involvement. Qualitative methods provided a better comprehension of user mannerisms and tasks in tandem with user involvement in SRM. Qualitative methods helped create a process model that produced definite results. They used Quantitative methods to measure the theoretical model resulting from the qualitative study. Both qualitative and quantitative methods gave a better context and measurability to their study hence better outcomes. (Spears & Barki, 2010) </p>

			<ol>
				<li> Raises organizational awareness of Information security risks and controls.</li>
				<li> Contributes to an alignment between SRM and the business context.</li>
				<li> Leads to more organizational awareness of IS security. (Spears & Barki, 2010)</li>

				<li> Contributes to perceived improvements in control development within the business. </li>
				<li> Positively influences the performance of security controls. (Spears & Barki, 2010) </li>
			</ol>

			<p align="justify">Under the emergent interactions theory, the authors reported emergent interactions between users and IS experts. (Spears & Barki, 2010) Based on the findings lack of user access might negatively impact risk assessment hence affect the choice between Qualitative and Quantitative assessment methods employed. This can only be mitigated by Involving users. </p>

									<p align="justify"><small>Could not agree any more regarding the user's involvement process in the over all organizational structure as a clear trend to maintain the specific security objectives maintaining a clear understanding of the SRM and business alignment as you have mentioned.  </small></p>
									<p align="justify"><small>Lack of access could trigger more issues than choosing the assessment methods only. To derive to a definite answer we would have to depend on some unsolicited assumptions which would eventually impact the analysis. You could emphasis on other factors as well in terms of mitigating the stated situation. </small></p>

								<p align="justify"><small> Hi David, I concur that those closest to the impacts should be consulted in a risk assessment and when performing risk assessment work within an organization it is important to gather as many points of view as possible. Not only are such measures important for reducing bias, the can also identifying interdependencies that may not be apparent to individuals surveyed. </small></p>
								<p align="justify"><small>An entire chapter of the first book on Factor Analysis Information Risk (FAIR) is focused on how to reliably interpret expert estimates on threats and impacts (Freund & Jones, 2014) indicating this is a problem other risk professionals have experienced. This project offers no options for interactions with ACME users so identification of risk may need to be somewhat of a thought or research exercise with well stated assumptions. </small></p>
