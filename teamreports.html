				<h4>Business Scenario </h4>
				<p align="justify"><small>Acme manufacturing has a workforce of 150 employees and uses spreadsheet for Information Management System while It’s estimated that 9 out 10 spreadsheets contain human errors (FERF, 2018).  As a result of new needs, Acme wants to procure Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system because they contribute to better management and outcomes (Chung et al, 2007). Acme has shortlisted its selection down to three options to implement ERP systems: </small></p>
				<p align="justify"><small>Commercial Off the Shelf (COTS) systems that have the advantages of the source code being in the form of a “black box” which protects the source code and vendor’s proprietary design and adequate support from vendor (Bhamangol B et al, 2011). </small></p>
				 <p align="justify"><small>An Open-Source solution (OSS) are freely available to the public but one has to use them at their own risk and may not have been programmed to suit Acme needs (Adrian MacKenzie, 2001).  </small></p>
				<p align="justify"><small>An in-house created solution built by a student that might sound fit because Acme needs will be inbuilt (Reeves, C, 2013) but academic work may sometimes fall short of industry standards and needs in terms of cyber security. </small></p>
				<h4>Business challenges and rationale </h4>
				<p align="justify"><small> COT Products: </h2>
				<p align="justify"><Understand the COTS products in relation to historical user hands-on experience with the system</small></p>
				<p align="justify"><Examine and validate its performance and scalability to ensure users are comfortable to use new system. </small></p>
				<p align="justify"><Test the COT to meet the security standards. </small></p>
				Assets should be secured in line with GPDR (Information Technology Resources Board, 1999) </small></p>
				<h4>Security risk of open-source software: </h4>
				<p align="justify"><small>The vulnerabilities in open-source software are availed to the public by National Vulnerability Database hence hackers exploit them before they are patched. </small></p>
				<p align="justify"><small>Open-source software has Licensing Compliance Risks because of many different types of open-source licenses (Cypress Data Defense, 2020). </small></p>
				<h4>Solutions created by student: </h4>
				<p align="justify"><small>Students lack hands on industrial experience in cyber security hence their product might have many vulnerabilities. Additionally, students may lack necessary resources to invest in skilled programing expertise to program secure and robust software. </small></p>
				<h4>Outline business challenges, the existing model</h4>
				<p align="justify"><small>Aligning the product with existing business regulatory compliance. </small></p>
				<p align="justify"><small>The existing reporting mechanism should be compliant to the new COTS systems. </small></p>
				<p align="justify"><small>Ensuring backups are accessed and stored in line with GPDR regulation. </small></p>
				<h4>Recommendation </h4>
				<p align="justify"><small> COTS systems is recommended because the risk of patching the software to protect it from existing and imminent vulnerabilities is the responsibility of the vendor who must be GPDR compliant. IBM Disaster Recovery System is recommended because it guarantees successful data recovery, provides near-zero Recovery Point Objective, withstand earthquake and has inbuilt numerous alternative uninterruptible power supplies system(IBM,2021). </small></p>
				<h4>Methodology/Tools </h4>
				<p align="justify"><small>The investigating team will use qualitative risk determination methodology because it uses historical data, systems performance, conduct of employees and interviews to ascertain risk’s level and/or likelihood (Cyber Security Foundation, 2021). Risk Assessment ascertains the magnitude of the probable threats and the risks connected to assets throughout the System Development Life Cycle. This aids in ascertaining suitable counter measures to deal with the risk in the mitigation process. (Stoneburner et al, 2002). Figure 1 in the appendix shows the Acme Manufacturing Risk Assessment Methodology Flowchart. </small></p>
				<h4>Risk management theories and practices</h4> 
				<p align="justify"><small>The NIST Cyber Security Framework will be adopted because it recommends measuring the existing security profile then comparing against its principles and standards. The profile is then matched to one of NIST’s four Target Profiles which shows gaps in policies and pinpointing preferred result. As shown in figure 2 in the appendix, the Framework defines Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond and Recover as continuous fundamental activities of risk management process that aid Enterprises to meticulously evaluate their existing cybersecurity (Governing Institute, 2015). </small></p>

				<h4>Timeline </h4>
				<p align="justify"><small> Figure 1: Project Timeline and Figure 2: Project Milestones on the appendix shows project timelines </small></p>
