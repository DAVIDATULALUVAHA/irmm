			<p align="justify"> According to Roy et al (2015) overall causes of risks are not limited to: </p>
			<p align="justify"> 1.    Risks connected to software programming like: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>  Underestimating resources</li> 
			<li>  Unpredictability of users and customers</li> 
			<li>  Vague requirements</li> 
			<li>  Wrong designs</li> 
			<li>  Poor or wrong work environment </li> 
			<li>  Risks associated with developing systems </li> 
			 <li>  Insufficient management process</li> 
			</ul>
			<p align="justify"> 2.    Technical risks linked to technology like: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>  In availability of premeditated framework  </li> 
			<li>  Slow acceptance of new technology </li> 
			<li>  Supply Chain difficulties</li>   
			<li>  Improper handling of change </li>   
			<li>  Over reliance on technology to solve problems </li>
			</ul>
			   
			<p align="justify"> 3.    Internal and External causes </p>
			<p align="justify"> 4.    Recognized and unknown causes </p>
			<p align="justify"> 5.    Risks of contradictory requirements </p>
			<p align="justify"> According to Ross et al (2018) Systems Security Engineering(SSE) can provide the following solutions to causes of risk: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>   It can aid in applying suitable security principles, concepts, methods, and practices during the system life cycle to attain stakeholders aims for the protection of assets from threats</p>
			<li>   Help reduce system flaws that contribute to security vulnerability to prevent the systems from being predisposed to adversity. </p>
			<li>   Give agreeable base of evidence that supports claims that the desired level of trustworthiness has been attained in systems. </p>
			<li>   Defines system security requirements and associated verification methods; </p>
			<li>     Identifies and assesses vulnerabilities and susceptibility to life cycle disruptions, hazards, and threats</p>

										<p align="justify">You have successfully chosen few of the causes which would trigger major risks and I liked the way you have categorised them as well. </p>
										<p align="justify">As you have mentioned in your first point and is also reflected through the mitigation point that scope-definitions of the processes- constraint declarations- clarity on the roles and objectives are the major impudent against which the over all security is assessed. According to Roy et al (2015) alone requirement analysis or verification and validation process is not enough to establish a solid security against the risk factors. An overall reliance of trust based concept should be established so that the subjective and contradictory needs of the stakeholders get addressed and only then the targeted cause of the risk factors could be eliminated.  </p>
										<p align="justify">As you have rightfully mentioned, as a process of mitigation, building up a targeted reasoning by means of quantitative and qualitative based analysis to produce substantiated  conclusion  is a good approach to tackle the scenarios like 'unknown causes'. </p>
										<p align="justify">You have also mentioned some of the system flaws that contribute to 'security vulnerability'. The term system security's primary objective is to maintain stakeholder's security commitment and to reduce the impact on tangible and intangible asset. As a part of mitigation process a combination of proactive and reactive approach should be adopted 'in the form of a concept of secure function' that addresses the spectrum of asset loss and associated consequences. This would mean to head for a well planned proactive plan to avoid any sorts of loss of asset. </p>
										<p align="justify">Even though you have mentioned this in your last mitigation point but it would be interesting to see more  discussion around your last point -  Risks of contradictory requirements; </p>
