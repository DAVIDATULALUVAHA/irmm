		<h4>How can we state how good expert judgements are, and how can we improve them?</h4>
		<p align="justify"> According to Rolf & Benedikte(2014)  expert judgements, should be as unbiased as  attainable,  while  subjectivity  should be used at  that valuation  and decision-making stage. By diminishing the volume of subjectivity from the actual analysis, or giving documentation and transparency, the level of risk associated with a certain activity or technology will be better understood. To improve on expert judgement, Rolf & Benedikte(2014)  says that the whole expert judgement process should be well documented so that  as new evidence becomes available, understanding the rationale for the probability values or distributions will allow the judgements to be reinterpreted instead of being discarded. </p>

			<h4>Risk and the NSA Hard Problems</h4>
			
						<font size="3" face="Arial" color="black"
			<p align="justify"> According to Roy et al (2015) overall causes of risks are not limited to: </p>
			<p align="justify"> 1.    Risks connected to software programming like: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>  Underestimating resources</li> 
			<li>  Unpredictability of users and customers</li> 
			<li>  Vague requirements</li> 
			<li>  Wrong designs</li> 
			<li>  Poor or wrong work environment </li> 
			<li>  Risks associated with developing systems </li> 
			 <li>  Insufficient management process</li> 
			</ul>
			<p align="justify"> 2.    Technical risks linked to technology like: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>  In availability of premeditated framework  </li> 
			<li>  Slow acceptance of new technology </li> 
			<li>  Supply Chain difficulties</li>   
			<li>  Improper handling of change </li>   
			<li>  Over reliance on technology to solve problems </li>
			</ul>
			   
			<p align="justify"> 3.    Internal and External causes </p>
			<p align="justify"> 4.    Recognized and unknown causes </p>
			<p align="justify"> 5.    Risks of contradictory requirements </p>
			<p align="justify"> According to Ross et al (2018) Systems Security Engineering(SSE) can provide the following solutions to causes of risk: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>   It can aid in applying suitable security principles, concepts, methods, and practices during the system life cycle to attain stakeholders aims for the protection of assets from threats</p>
			<li>   Help reduce system flaws that contribute to security vulnerability to prevent the systems from being predisposed to adversity. </p>
			<li>   Give agreeable base of evidence that supports claims that the desired level of trustworthiness has been attained in systems. </p>
			<li>   Defines system security requirements and associated verification methods; </p>
			<li>     Identifies and assesses vulnerabilities and susceptibility to life cycle disruptions, hazards, and threats</p>
			</ul>
